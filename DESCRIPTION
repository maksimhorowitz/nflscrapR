Description: This package allows data driven sports enthusiasts to use the NFL JSON API data
    to perform detailed analysis at game, season, and player levels. The functions within
    this package help parse and clean the data from NFL.com for R users. This package was
    built to enhance advanced sports analytics research specifically for American football
    with the hopes of developing metrics and insights that could potentially be useful for
    professional NFL teams as well as the public.
